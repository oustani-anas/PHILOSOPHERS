# Philosophers Simulation with Threads and Mutexes

# Introduction
Welcome to my philosophers simulation project! In this project, we delve into the world of philosophy, exploring the dynamics of philosophers sitting around a round table, eating spaghetti, and pondering life's questions. The simulation involves using threads and mutexes to ensure synchronization and safe interaction among the philosophers.

## Philosophy and Simulation
Philosophy, rooted in the pursuit of wisdom and understanding, raises profound questions about existence, knowledge, values, and more. Our simulation brings philosophers together to simulate their interactions, thoughts, and meals. Through the use of threads and mutexes, we aim to create a realistic representation of philosophers' lives.

## Project Highlights
 - Language Used: C
 - Concurrency: Utilizing threads for each philosopher
 - Synchronization: Implementing mutexes to manage shared resources (forks)
 - State Logging: Displaying philosophers' activities and state changes
 - Threading: Using pthread library for thread creation and management
